Export Report To CSV
================================

The mashup allows to export data from the created custom graphical reports and get the information represented in a tabular form.

For example, we have a report which shows how many bugs and user stories are in every project:

![](./report.png)

When you export such a report into .csv file, you'll see the project names and user stories and bugs count shown as columns in the file.
